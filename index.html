                            Pastry in Uzbekistan, like in many cultures, has a rich tradition and history. The influence of various cultures and the Silk Road has brought a variety of pastry techniques and recipes to the region. Here are some notable pastries and sweets from Uzbekistan:<br>

Samsa (Samosa): While not a sweet pastry, samsa is a savory pastry filled with meat, onions, and spices, baked in a tandoor or oven.<br>

Baklava: This sweet pastry, made of layers of filo filled with nuts and sweetened with syrup or honey, is common in Uzbekistan due to the influence of Middle Eastern cuisine.<br>

Halva: Although more of a confection than a pastry, halva is a sweet treat made from sesame paste or other nut butters mixed with sugar and other ingredients.<br>

Nishalda: A traditional sweet often served during the spring festival of Navruz. It's made from whipped egg whites, sugar, and a special root extract called "nishalda."<br>

Navat: A traditional Uzbek candy made from crystallized sugar. It is often enjoyed with tea.
